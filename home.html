            <h3>Sam Smith</h3>
            <p>One of the biggest decisions you will make financially is what home to 
            purchase. To find that perfect house, every homeowner needs a real estate 
            agent that will take the time to understand their big picture goals and to 
            educate them on the home buying or selling process. Explaining each step 
            along the way and what to anticipate next keeps expectations realistic and 
            lessen the unknowns. </p><br>
            <p>Backed with a full support and marketing staff to assist in promoting 
            your listing effectively, your home will be at the forefront of buyers that 
            are searching in the area. Knowing what it takes to compete in a market 
            driven by technology and online information is vital in selling a home. It 
            is what sets your home from the rest of the inventory and a savvy agent 
            knows where to find the buyer and bring them to your door.</p><br>
            <p>During the process of buying or selling a home you will spend a lot of 
            time with a real estate agent. It's important to start working with the 
            right agent who has the knowledge, experience, and patience to help you move 
            on into your new home.</p><br>
            <p>I look forward to working with you!</p><br>
